    <h1>Welcome to Fullstack Course</h1>
    <h2>About course</h2>
    <p1>Full stack web development is a sought-after career option today.Companies actively seek developers who have 
        sound specializations in these multiple fields.However today,the definition of full stack is quite dynamic
        and in some aspects company-specific too.For example,cloud computing and deployment are some of the skills
        that a full stack developer should have along with the ones stated before.A full stack web developer
        eliminates the need to hire individual role-specific people by handling entire application themselves.
